            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to 
                the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
                and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, 
                and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
                for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, 
                and the Document Object Model (DOM).
